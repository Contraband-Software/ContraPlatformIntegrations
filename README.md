# ContraPlatformItegrations, for Unity
 
A singleton manager for Android and iOS platform integrations such as ads, data privacy and cloud saves (Android-only currently).

This is a Unity asset package, not a package manager package. Import it by downloading the .unitypackage file in the `~Relases` directory and importing it into Unity.
